/**
 * i18n bootstrap — react-i18next with inline JSON resources.
 *
 * English is the default language (and the fallback for any missing key).
 * The user's choice is persisted in localStorage (`cth.language`). With nothing
 * saved the app starts in English, ALWAYS — it deliberately does not read
 * navigator.language. Auto-detect would change the UI out from under every
 * existing user on a non-English machine, who never asked for a translation and
 * may not want a partial one. Nothing moves until someone picks a language in
 * Settings.
 *
 * Adding a language: drop a `locales/<code>.json` with the exact same key
 * tree as `en.json`, register it in `resources` and `supportedLngs`, and add
 * an entry to `LANGUAGES` (Settings → General exposes the picker from that
 * list). No other code needs to change.
